huggingface:

Hugging Face is at the forefront of AI development, and I resonate deeply with your mission of advancing open AI research and making the best models accessible to all. Through client projects at UnleashAI and countless side projects, I have consistently relied on Hugging Faceâ€™s models and tools to build impactful AI solutions.

As a person, I am deeply curious, adaptable, and driven by a passion for building AI systems that create real-world impact. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy tackling complex challenges, and have a strong track record of designing and deploying scalable AI solutions. Whether optimizing automation pipelines or experimenting with new model architectures, I am always seeking ways to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

At Viasat, I developed an AI-powered executive summary generator, bringing AI automation to backend tooling. My work in AI automation consulting has also equipped me with the ability to translate complex problems into impactful, user-friendly AI-powered applications. With expertise in Python, PyTorch, and cloud infrastructure, I am eager to contribute to Hugging Face's dynamic team and inspiring mission.
